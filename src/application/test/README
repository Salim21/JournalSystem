There are three JUnit test files:

1) AccountTest.java       --> Account.java
2) AuthenticatorTest.java --> Authenticator.java
3) UtilitiesTest.java     --> Utilities.java

The AccountTest.java test file is in the application folder because
Account.java contains protected methods. Therefore they must be in the 
same package.
