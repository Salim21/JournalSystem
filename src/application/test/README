There are three JUnit test files:

1) AccountTest.java          tests   Account.java
2) AuthenticatorTest.java    tests   Authenticator.java
3) UtilitiesTest.java        tests   Utilities.java

The AccountTest.java test file is in the application folder because
Account.java contains protected methods. Therefore they must be in the 
same package.
